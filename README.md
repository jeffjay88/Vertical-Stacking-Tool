# Vertical-Stacking-Tool
A vertical stacking tool used by the Ghana Meteorological Agency for their day to day vertical climate data stacking. 
The aim of this tool is to reduce the human effort by multiples of time. Presently, the first version has been deployed which is purely an installer (~32mb). 
This is entirely a python based application, with a Tkinter interface. As procedure, run the script in any python idle (preferably spyder, jupyter-notebook) and fill the requirements with the necessary details, and then voila.
